              <h3 class="text-center">His Journey</h3>

            <p>Kyle Dake is great because he was a sucessful wrestler since Highschool. He also knows how to work hard and stay consistant, and that alone is something special because most people are willing to work hard but not everyone is able to stay consistant in working hard for 10+ years of their lives in order to be great. Some people may say that it was easy for him to be great because his dad was a great coach and a great wrestler, so he was able to be caoched by him for his whole life and his dad didn't make him take any breaks. Even though this was true it takes morethan other people trying to make you great, you also have to want to be great yourself.
